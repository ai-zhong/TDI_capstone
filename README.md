# The Data Incubator Capstone Project

The project used the Patent assignment data from USPTO (https://www.uspto.gov/) to analyze what is happening in different sectors. The assignment activity is the activity happens between company to company or person to company. This might be a merger/acquisition or an employee assigns its patents to the current employer etc. 

The interactive plots need to be downloaded as html to view on local computer.

Inside the interactive plots folder, there are 10 files each represent a model ran for that sector. It shows the top hot words appeared in that sector.
